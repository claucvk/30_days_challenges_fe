## Project Idea
I wanted to build an app that will help people to try something new in 30 days.

I came up with the idea after watching Matt Cutts Ted Talk https://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days

Here there is an abstract of Matt Cutts speech where he explains very well what this is about.
 "The idea is actually pretty simple. Think about something you've always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days. It turns out 30 days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit -- like watching the news -- from your life."

 The app provides a platform where people can save the challenge, keep record of their progress and share it with friends and family.

## General Approach
I started defining the planning documents that included wireframes, ERD, and user stories. Next I
developed a schedule for production. Following by pseudocode. Finally, I used Wunderlist to monitor progress.

## User stories
- As a user I want to sign up/ sign in to use the app.
- As a user I want to create a new challenge to start my 30 days adventure.
- As a user I want to set a quantifiable goal to define my challenge.
- As a user I want to write notes in a diary to support my progress during the 30 days.
- As a user I want to see my progress (days) in my diary to continue with my challenge.
- As a user I want to share my challenges on social networks to inspire others and share my experience to friends and family.
- As a user I want to update my profile information if I need it.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS / CSS Grid
- JavaScript/ Jquery / AJAX

## Issues
- I would like to the improve the UI looks.
- Connecting and displaying properly the data on the page was hard. It helped being methodical and research on Internet possibles solutions to the problems  encountered.
- Get a nice and clean structure could be tedious, but using CSS Grid make the task easier.
